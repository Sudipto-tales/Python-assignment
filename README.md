# MD5 Algorithm 
 
  Overview :
  This program implements the MD5 hashing algorithm in Python. It takes an input message, processes it, and returns the MD5 hash in hexadecimal format. It includes padding, transformation, and final hash generation.

 <b>How It Works</b>
   Padding: The input message is padded to ensure its length is a multiple of 512 bits, appending necessary bits and the original length.
   MD5 Transformation: The message is processed in 512-bit blocks. Each block undergoes 64 rounds of transformations using bitwise operations and predefined constants.
   Final Hash: The final MD5 hash is calculated by combining updated hash values and returned as a hexadecimal string.
  <b>Usage</b>
To compute the MD5 hash of a string, call the md5() function:
hash_result = md5("2003")
print("MD5 hash of '2003':", hash_result)

This will return the MD5 hash of the string "2003".
